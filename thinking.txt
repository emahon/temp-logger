Two main goals for this program:
1. Make sure the logging information is retained on an unexpected shutdown
2. Minimize processing as much as possible

To achieve 1, it probably makes sense to close the file after every write.
However, opening and closing the file on every write violates 2.


How frequently do we want to write the data?
Well, how frequently is it refreshed? That's the fastest we could do it.
-could have a frequency control in command line invokation.
-Though does Windows allow for passing in of commands in a similar matter? It must.

Format: Probably CSV, it's easy to do and widely supported
I don't think C technically has CSV utilities but whatever, it's easy enough to do.

Line endings should be Windows-format, since this is a Windows program. So remember /r/n!
